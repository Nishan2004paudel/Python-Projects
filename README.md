# Python Projects 🐍

This repository contains a collection of small **Python projects** that I am building while exploring and learning Python.

These projects are part of my hands-on learning journey to strengthen core programming concepts, problem-solving skills, and practical implementation.

## Projects

### 1. Tic-Tac-Toe 🎮
A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built using Python.  
This project helped me practice basic game logic, user interaction, and working with Python libraries for building interactive applications.

### 2. Digital Clock ⏰
A simple digital clock application built using Python and Tkinter.  
This project displays the current time and date, updating every second in real time. It helped me understand GUI components, event scheduling, and time handling in Python.

### 3. Rock Paper Scissors ✊📄✂️
A simple Rock Paper Scissors game built using Python and Tkinter.  
This project allows a user to play against the computer, keeps track of scores, and displays results through a graphical interface. It helped me practice game logic, randomization, and event-driven programming with Python GUIs.

### 4. Coffee Ordering System ☕
A simple console-based coffee ordering system built using Python and object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.  
This project allows users to select coffee items from a menu, view their order, calculate the total price, and proceed to checkout. It helped me practice class design, object interaction, and basic user input handling in Python.

### 5. Calculator 🧮
A simple calculator application built using Python and Tkinter.  
This project performs basic arithmetic operations through a graphical user interface. It helped me understand GUI layout design, event handling, and evaluating expressions dynamically in Python.


> More Python projects will be added below as I continue learning and experimenting.
