# Python Projects 🐍

This repository contains a collection of small **Python projects** that I am building while exploring and learning Python.

These projects are part of my hands-on learning journey to strengthen core programming concepts, problem-solving skills, and practical implementation.

## Projects

### 1. Tic-Tac-Toe 🎮
A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built using Python.  
This project helped me practice basic game logic, user interaction, and working with Python libraries for building interactive applications.

### 2. Digital Clock ⏰
A simple digital clock application built using Python and Tkinter.  
This project displays the current time and date, updating every second in real time. It helped me understand GUI components, event scheduling, and time handling in Python.

### 3. Rock Paper Scissors ✊📄✂️
A simple Rock Paper Scissors game built using Python and Tkinter.  
This project allows a user to play against the computer, keeps track of scores, and displays results through a graphical interface. It helped me practice game logic, randomization, and event-driven programming with Python GUIs.

### 4. Coffee Ordering System ☕
A simple console-based coffee ordering system built using Python and object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.  
This project allows users to select coffee items from a menu, view their order, calculate the total price, and proceed to checkout. It helped me practice class design, object interaction, and basic user input handling in Python.

### 5. Calculator 🧮
A simple calculator application built using Python and Tkinter.  
This project performs basic arithmetic operations through a graphical user interface. It helped me understand GUI layout design, event handling, and evaluating expressions dynamically in Python.

### 6. Notepad 📝
A simple Notepad application built using Python and Tkinter.  
This project allows users to create, open, and save text files through a graphical interface. It helped me understand file handling, dialog boxes, and building basic text-editing applications using Python.

### 7. Image Viewer 🖼️
A simple image viewer application built using Python, Tkinter, and PIL.  
This project allows users to select and display image files through a graphical interface. It helped me understand file dialogs, image handling, and integrating external libraries with Tkinter.

### 8. Rent Calculator 🏠
A simple Python program that calculates and splits total living expenses among multiple people.  
This project considers rent, food expenses, electricity usage, and per-unit electricity charges to determine how much each person should pay. It helped me practice input handling, basic calculations, and logical flow in Python.

### 9. To Do App ✅
A simple command-line task management application built using Python.  
This project allows users to add, update, delete, and view tasks interactively. It helped me practice list operations, conditional logic, loops, and building menu-driven programs in Python.

### 10. QR Code Generator 🔳
A simple Python program that generates a QR code from a user-provided URL.  
This project uses the `qrcode` library to create and save QR codes as image files. It helped me understand working with external libraries, handling user input, and generating files programmatically in Python.

### 11. Interactive Dashboard 📊
A simple interactive dashboard built using Python and Dash.  
This project displays bar and line charts on a web-based dashboard, helping me understand data visualization, layout components, and building interactive web applications with Dash.

### 12. Typing Speed Test ⌨️
A simple Python program that measures typing speed and accuracy.  
This project calculates the time taken, words per minute (WPM), and number of typing errors by comparing user input with a given prompt. It helped me practice string manipulation, time measurement, and basic performance evaluation logic in Python.

### 13. Voting System Simulation 🗳️
A simple command-line voting system built using Python.  
This project simulates an election process where voters cast votes for two nominees using voter IDs. It calculates total votes, voting percentages, and declares the winner. It helped me practice loops, conditionals, list manipulation, and basic simulation logic in Python.


> More Python projects will be added below as I continue learning and experimenting.
