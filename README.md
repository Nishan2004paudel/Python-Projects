### 13. Voting System Simulation 🗳️
A simple command-line voting system built using Python.  
This project simulates an election process where voters cast votes for two nominees using voter IDs. It calculates total votes, voting percentages, and declares the winner. It helped me practice loops, conditionals, list manipulation, and basic simulation logic in Python.

### 14. Pencil Sketch Image Converter ✏️
A Python program that converts a color image into a pencil sketch effect.  
This project uses NumPy, ImageIO, SciPy, and OpenCV to process images through grayscale conversion, inversion, blurring, and blending techniques. It helped me understand basic image processing concepts and working with multiple scientific Python libraries.

### 15. Screenshot Tool 📸
A simple screenshot capture application built using Python and Tkinter.  
This project allows users to take a screenshot of the screen and save it as an image file. It helped me understand GUI interactions, file dialogs, and using external libraries for screen capture in Python.

### 16. Snake Game 🐍
A classic Snake game built using Python and Tkinter.  
This project features real-time movement, food generation, score tracking, collision detection, and game restart functionality. It helped me practice event handling, game loops, object-oriented design, and GUI-based game development in Python.

### 17. Spelling Checker 🔤
A simple spelling checker application built using Python, Tkinter, and TextBlob.  
This project takes user input, checks spelling mistakes, and displays the corrected text through a graphical interface. It helped me understand natural language processing basics and integrating external libraries with Python GUIs.

### 18. Text to Speech Converter 🔊
A Python program that converts text from a file into spoken audio.  
This project uses the gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) library to generate an audio file from text and play it. It helped me understand working with external libraries, file handling, and basic text-to-speech functionality in Python.

### 19. Emoji Face Drawing 😊
A simple Python program that draws an emoji-style face using the Turtle graphics module.  
This project uses basic drawing commands, shapes, and coordinates to create a visual emoji. It helped me understand graphical drawing, coordinate systems, and creative programming with Python.
